=== Wizard Session ===

Welcome to govbot! Let's set up your project.

? What data sources do you want to track?
> All states (47 jurisdictions)
  Select specific states

Tags let govbot categorize legislation by topics you care about.
Here's an example tag definition:

  education:
    description: |
      Legislation related to schools, education funding,
      curriculum standards, and educational policy.
    examples:
      - "Increases per-pupil funding for public schools"
      - "Mandates comprehensive sex education curriculum"

? How would you like to set up tags?
> Use the example "education" tag to start
  I'll create my own tags later

Publishing is configured for RSS feeds by default.
Your feeds will be generated in the "docs" directory.

? Base URL for your feeds: https://myuser.github.io/my-govbot

  ✓ Created govbot.yml
  ✓ Created .gitignore with .govbot
  ✓ Created .github/workflows/build.yml

Setup complete! Run 'govbot' again to start the pipeline.
