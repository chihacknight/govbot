=== Wizard Session ===

Welcome to govbot! Let's set up your project.

? What data sources do you want to track?
> All states (47 jurisdictions)
  Select specific states

Tags let govbot categorize legislation by topics you care about.
Here's an example tag definition:

  education:
    description: |
      Legislation related to schools, education funding,
      curriculum standards, and educational policy.
    examples:
      - "Increases per-pupil funding for public schools"
      - "Mandates comprehensive sex education curriculum"

? How would you like to set up tags?
  Use the example "education" tag to start
> I'll create my own tags later

To create a tag, copy this prompt into your preferred AI tool:

---
Create a govbot tag definition in YAML for tracking [YOUR TOPIC] legislation.
The tag should have:
- A description (multiline, covering subtopics)
- 2-3 example bill descriptions that would match
- Optional: include_keywords and exclude_keywords lists

Format:
  tag_name:
    description: |
      ...
    examples:
      - "..."
    include_keywords:
      - keyword1
    exclude_keywords:
      - keyword1
---

Paste the result into your govbot.yml under the 'tags:' section.

Publishing is configured for RSS feeds by default.
Your feeds will be generated in the "docs" directory.

? Base URL for your feeds: https://example.com

  ✓ Created govbot.yml
  ✓ Created .gitignore with .govbot
  ✓ Created .github/workflows/build.yml

Setup complete! Run 'govbot' again to start the pipeline.
